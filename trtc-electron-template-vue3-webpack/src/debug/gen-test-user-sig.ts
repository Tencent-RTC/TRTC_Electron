/*
 * Module:   GenerateTestUserSig
 *
 * Function: Used to generate UserSig for testing, UserSig is a security protection signature designed by Tencent Cloud for its cloud services.
 *           Its calculation method is to encrypt SDKAppID, UserID, and EXPIRETIME, with the encryption algorithm being HMAC-SHA256.
 *
 * Attention: Please do not publish the following code in your official online version of the App, for the following reasons:
 *
 *            Although the code in this file can correctly calculate UserSig, it is only suitable for quickly getting the basic functions of the SDK to work and is not suitable for online products.
 *            This is because the SECRETKEY in the client code can be easily decompiled and cracked, especially the difficulty of cracking the code on the web side is almost zero. 
 *            Once your key is leaked, attackers can calculate the correct UserSig to steal your Tencent Cloud traffic.
 *
 *            The correct approach is to place the calculation code for UserSig and the encryption key on your business server, and then have the App obtain the UserSig calculated in real-time from your server as needed.
 *            Since the cost of cracking a server is higher than that of cracking a client app, the server calculation scheme can better protect your encryption key.
